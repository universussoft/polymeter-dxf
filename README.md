# Polymeter DXF Processor

**Polymeter DXF Processor** is a Flask-based web application designed to process DXF (Drawing Exchange Format) files. It extracts polylines, assigns nodes, merges connected polylines into branches, and generates downloadable outputs including a CSV file, an updated DXF file, and a JPG preview.

---

## Features

- **DXF File Processing**: Upload a DXF file to extract and process polylines.
- **Node Assignment**: Automatically assigns unique node IDs to polyline start and end points.
- **Branch Merging**: Merges connected polylines into branches for simplified representation.
- **Output Generation**:
  - **CSV File**: Contains branch information (start node, end node, length, coordinates).
  - **Updated DXF File**: Includes original polylines and labeled nodes.
  - **JPG Preview**: Visual preview of the processed DXF file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple web interface for uploading and downloading files.

## Usage

1. **Upload a DXF File**:
   - On the homepage, click the "Upload DXF" button and select a `.dxf` file.

2. **Process the File**:
   - The application will process the file and generate:
     - A CSV file with branch information.
     - An updated DXF file with labeled nodes.
     - A JPG preview of the processed DXF file.

3. **Download the Outputs**:
   - Click the provided links to download the CSV, DXF, and JPG files.

## API Endpoints

The application exposes the following endpoints:

- **`POST /process-dxf`**:
  - Upload a DXF file for processing.
  - Returns JSON with URLs to download the generated files.

- **`GET /download/<filename>`**:
  - Download the generated files (`final_branches.csv`, `dxf_preview.jpg`, `processed_output.dxf`).
